=== Description ===
* The GVS-32U4 is an Arduino Leonardo compatible board.

== Features ==

The GVS-32U4 board is the second generation of GVS-32U4 board based on the previous X1 Revision board. The board includes the features:

* Arduino Leonardo compatible
* Program board using the Arduino IDE
* Atmel [https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATmega32U4 ATmega32U4]
** Low-power
** Max. Operating Frequency: 16 MHz
** 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller
** 32KB flash program memory
** 2.5KB SRAM
** 1KB EEPROM
** USB 2.0 full-speed/low speed device
** 12-channel 10-bit A/D-converter
** Pin Count: 44
** Max I/O Pins: 26
** Ext Interrupts: 13
** USB Transceiver: Yes (1)
** USB Speed: Full Speed
* USB-Mini connector
* Standard connection as USB peripheral
* ATMega32U4 has a built in USB interfaces so it does not require an FTDI part
* Three flexible power options - Jumper controlled
* Power from the USB port
* The USB input is polyfuse protected
* Power from External VIN pins (> 6.5V required)
* Uses an on-board Low Dropout (LDO) Voltage Regulator (1.4V min drop)
* Embedded power option
* Power from reverse powering one of the GVS connector power pins
* Red Power LED
* GVS connectors for all input/output pins
* GVS wiring is compatible with standard servo pinouts on 0.1" pitch
* Note that typical servo connectors are wider than 0.1"
* GVS wiring provides the ultimate in flexibility since individual sensors and outputs can be fully connected with standard 3-pin to 3-pin cables
* Pololu is a good source of 0.1" pitch crimp connector housings and wires with pre-crimped terminals
* Four solid 4-40 screw mounting holes
* Mounting holes are spaced at 41mm x 41mm
* Board size is 49mm x 49mm (less than 2"x2" which is smaller than the Leonardo 2.7" x 2.1")
* Rounded board corners for installation into chassis with internal rounded corners such as inexpensive plastic project boxes
* HWB jumper for programming part over the USB
* Program using [http://www.atmel.com/tools/FLIP.aspx ATmel FLIP]
* Pullup resistor to VCC
* Compatible with Arduino Leonardo bootloader

=== Ownership ===

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by us based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not us.
