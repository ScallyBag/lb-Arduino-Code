* These are the [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=DIGIO-128 DigIO-128 card] example files.
* The [https://github.com/douggilliland/lb-Arduino-Code/tree/master/libraries/LandBoards_Digio128V2 Library for the DIGIO-128 card is here]

[https://www.tindie.com/products/land_boards/64128-channel-digital-io-card-digio-128/ Card is sold here on Tindie]

=== Files ===

* [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=DIGIO-128 DIGIO-128 Card] Example Code
* These files use the [https://github.com/douggilliland/lb-Arduino-Code/tree/master/libraries/LandBoards_Digio128V2 LandBoards_DIGIO128V2 library] which views the card as a 128-bit space
** Easier to use - just an extended version of the Arduino digital read/write functions

==== DIGIO128_Access ====

* Uses an I2CRPT - I2C Multiplexer chip to communicate with the Digio-128 card
* Uses the serial port on the Arduino to allow access to individual bits
** H=Set a bit High
** L=Set a bit Low
** R=Read bit (no dir change)
** P=Poll input bit

==== DIGIO128_Blink ====

* Demonstrates the [https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalwrite/ Arduino digitalWrite] function on the DIGIO-128 card
* Blink LED on bit 0
* Syntax: digitalWrite(pin, value)

==== DIGIO128_Blink128 ====

* Make all 128 lines outputs
* Blink each line, one at a time

==== DIGIO128_DigitalReadSerial ====

* Demonstrates the [https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalread/ Arduino digitalRead] function
* Reads digital input bit 0 from DIGIO-128 and prints the result to the Serial Monitor

=== Ownership ===

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by us based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not us.
