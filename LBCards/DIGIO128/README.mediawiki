== land-boards DigIO-128 Card Example Arduino Source Code Files ==

* These are the [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=DIGIO-128 DigIO-128 card] example files.

=== Two Libraries ===

* The [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=DIGIO-128 DigIO-128 card] has two libraries
** The preferred version uses the [https://github.com/land-boards/lb-Arduino-Code/tree/master/LBCards/DIGIO128/LandBoards_DIGIO128V2_Library_Based LandBoards_DIGIO128V2 library] which views the card as a 128-bit space
*** Easier to use - just an extended version of the Arduino digital read/write functions
** The other version uses the [https://github.com/land-boards/lb-Arduino-Code/tree/master/LBCards/DIGIO128/LandBoards_MCP23017_Library_Based LandBoards_MCP23017 library] and views the card as 8 chips
*** Requires paying close attention to the mapping/access to the specific chips
* Older - LandBoards_DIGIO128 library has been deprecated

== Features ==

* 128 bits of General Purpose Digital I/O (GPIO)
** Card uses I2C addresses 0x20-0x27 for I/O and 0x50 for Configuration EEPROM
* (8) of [http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/20001952C.pdf MCP23017] - 16 bit GPIO
** I2C (Two Wire) host interface
** 100/400 KHZ operation
** 25mA sink/source capability per I/O
*** Limited by current in/out of the IC
* [https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21210N.pdf 24LC024] Configuration/Personality EEPROM
* Jumper selectable I2C terminators
* Single 4-pin host interface connector (Ground, Power, Clock, Data)
* (8) I/O Connectors
** 20 pin, 0.1" Pitch
** 16 digital I/O
** 2 Power
** 2 Ground
** Interrupt connectors
* Power Connector
** 3.3V or 5V operation
* Compatible with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black
* 95x95mm form factor
* (4) 6-32 mounting holes - one on each corner

=== Ownership ===

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created or inspired by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
*** There are a lot of MCP23017 libraries in the wild.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not us.
