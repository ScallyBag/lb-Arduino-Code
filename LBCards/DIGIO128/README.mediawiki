=== Two Libraries ===

* The [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=DIGIO-128 DigIO-128 card] has two libraries
** The preferred version uses the [https://github.com/land-boards/lb-Arduino-Code/tree/master/LBCards/DIGIO128/LandBoards_DIGIO128V2_Library_Based LandBoards_DIGIO128V2 library] which views the card as a 128-bit space
*** Easier to use - just an extended version of the Arduino digital read/write functions
** The other version uses the [https://github.com/land-boards/lb-Arduino-Code/tree/master/LBCards/DIGIO128/LandBoards_MCP23017_Library_Based LandBoards_MCP23017 library] and views the card as 8 chips
*** Requires paying close attention to the mapping/access to the specific chips
* Older - LandBoards_DIGIO128 library has been deprecated

=== Ownership ===

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created or inspired by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
*** There are a lot of MCP23017 libraries in the wild.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not us.
