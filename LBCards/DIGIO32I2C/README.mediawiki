* I2C Interface
** Daisy-chain I2C connector
** I2C Termination jumpers for end of I2C chain
** I2C Address select jumper (2 addresses - can support up to 4 cards)
* Power Options
** Supports 3.3V or 5V signal levels
** Fuse protected power output on DB-37
* Power connector (not required for minimal loads
* ODAS form factor (width is 95 mm)
* 6-32 Mounting holes

== land-boards DigIO32-I2C Card Source Code Files ==

* These are the [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=DIGIO32-I2C DigIO32-I2C card] Source code files.
* Here is the [https://github.com/douggilliland/lb-Arduino-Code/tree/master/libraries/LandBoards_DIGIO32_I2C Land Board DIGIO32-I2C Library] code

=== Files ===

==== DIGIO32I2CFAT ====

* Original Factory Acceptance Test for the DIGIO32-I2C card
** Replaced by [https://github.com/douggilliland/lb-Arduino-Code/tree/master/LBCards/ODAS ODAS Tester]
* Uses an Arduino UNO with a Host USB connection
* Performs loopback testing from one chip to the next (0-1 chips)
* Also, attempts to program the EEPROM and presents the result if successful
* Runs with Host Serial Connection
* Loops on running the loopback test forever - good for endurance testing

=== Ownership ===

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by us based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not us.
