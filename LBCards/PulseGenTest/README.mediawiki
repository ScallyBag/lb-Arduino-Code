== PulseGenTest Card Test Software ==

<img src="http://land-boards.com/blwiki/images/2/2c/PulseGen_5242-720px.JPG" alt="PulseGenTest Card Test Station Image"></img>

== Features ==

* Very fast pulse edge (typical 2 nS rise time) and symmetric high/low drive
* Power Supply from 2V to 6V range so battery operation is possible eliminating need for power supply, etc
* 5mm Terminal Block for power allows for batteries, etc to be easily connected without soldering
* 50 or 75 Ohm (other values could be made, send us your specs and we can add them)
* BNC connectors on both ends
* Connectors are a stuffing option with either BNC or SMA connectors (SMA is a special order so contact us)
* Four mounting holes - 4-40 holes
* Rounded corners fit more easily into plastic enclosures with inside radius at the corners
* Nuts and washers for BNC mounting included
* Small size (1.8" x 1.3)

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by us based on the work of others.

== Warning ==

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melts to a puddle, it's on you not us.
