== Features ==

* [https://www.arduino.cc/en/pmwiki.php?n=Main/ArduinoBoardProMini Arduino Pro Mini]
* Detachable Human Interface design (HID)
* Flexible Input power
** On-board DC/DC buck regulator allows 7-23V input
** Direct 7-9V input (USE VRAW jumper)
** 3.3V of 5V Arduino support
** Measured 12 mA with 9V input and 3.3V Arduino Pro Mini
* I/O Boards
** DB-25
* Mounts in a standard extruded Aluminum enclosure

=== Arduino Pro Mini ===

* Inexpensive and widely available
* [https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/Arduino-Pro-Mini-schematic.pdf Arduino Pro Mini sCHEMATIC]
* I/O - 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs)
** Serial: 0 (RX) and 1 (TX).
*** Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data.
*** These pins are connected to the TX-0 and RX-1 pins of the six pin header.
** External Interrupts: 2 and 3. 
*** These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value. 
*** See the attachInterrupt function for details.
** PWM: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. 
*** Provide 8-bit PWM output with the analogWrite function.
** SPI: 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK). 
*** These pins support SPI communication, which, although provided by the underlying hardware.
** LED: 13.
*** There is a built-in LED connected to digital pin 13.
*** When the pin is HIGH value, the LED is on, when the pin is LOW, it's off.
** 6 analog inputs
* On-board resonator (8 or 16 MHz)
* Reset button
* A six pin header can be connected to an FTDI cable provide USB power and communication to the board
* 3.3 or 5V
* 8 MHz (3.3V) or 16 MHz (5V)
* Programmable in Arduino IDE

** 3.35-12 V (3.3V model) or 5-12 V (5V model)

==== RF Filters ===
